# 001. Record architecture decisions.

Date: 2023-05-20

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We want to record the architectural decisions made on this project.

This first ADR introduces this practice to record significant changes made on this project.

The selected template aligns with the status of this project (simple and concrete), previous changes were documented on paper such as technologies and stacks, so in feature, we will use this approach to document.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records, as [described by Michael Nygard](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture-decision-record/blob/main/templates/decision-record-template-by-michael-nygard/index.md) proposes.

This initial record serves as template for future ADRs.


## Consequences

Design decisions made after May 2023 will be documented in this way, this represents an effort to create the habit to record changes in this way, the advantage of this change is the possibility to centralize and keep an historical of project changes as long as it may growth.
